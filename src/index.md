Greenspace Hack has created a smartphone app to provide detailed and granular data for local governments to design better green spaces for health and wellbeing.

The app builds on NEST (Natural Environment Scoring Tool) to offer a simple, intuitive method for community groups, parish councils, and other stakeholders to provide information about their local green spaces - “curated crowdsourcing”.

As well as informing the planning process, the collected data is released openly for projects such as OpenStreetMap, so that better greenspace information is available to residents in the apps they use every day.
 
### Our outcomes

* Data for communities to pursue their own objectives
* A publicly available open map documenting green spaces
* Promoting green space as an agenda issue
* Creating an open dataset and standardised survey that could be replicated globally
* Creating a datasource setting a new standard of detail for global mapping resources
* More publicly orientated local government
