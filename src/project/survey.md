## Developing the survey

From a review of previous literature, we identified 12 existing audit tools suitable for green spaces. We concluded that NEST (Natural Environment Scoring Tool), developed by Chris Gidlow at Staffordshire University, was the most appropriate base for the project.

Adapting the 47-question variant of NEST to the “curated crowdsourcing” model, suitable for wider participation by non-professionals, required some small changes. In particular, our first exercises showed that some fields, particularly the classification into 11 typologies, were not consistently understood by assessors and thus were best treated as optional. It is notable that other audit tools vary greatly in the typologies they offer, suggesting there is no widespread consensus.

Because our focus was on gathering information rather than rating green spaces, we did not use the weighting measures from NEST. 

The initial focus of Greenspace Hack has been largely a utilitarian audit - collecting the features and facilities of each greenspace. In the future, we hope to extend this to an opportunity audit and a capability audit.

In the future, we also hope to develop a shorter survey with simple, factual, unambiguous questions suitable for mass participation. Our expectation is that the data will not be used standalone, but in conjunction with other open datasets which will allow more detailed analysis of connectivity, facilities and demographics: therefore not everything needs to be collected in one single survey. We also hope to continue to investigate ‘Internet of Things’ technology for auditing green spaces, such as noise measurement and machine learning from imagery.
